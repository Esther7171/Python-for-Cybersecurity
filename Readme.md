## Chapter 1 ‚Äì Introduction to Python

Hi üëã, in this repo I‚Äôm sharing my **Python notes from beginner to advanced**, along with **competitive programming solutions** and **custom cybersecurity scripts**.

Let‚Äôs start with the basics.

Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** in **1991**.
Over the years, it has become one of the most popular programming languages because it is:

* Easy to read and write
* Open-source and free
* Widely used in **cybersecurity, automation, AI, web development, and competitive programming**

---

### What is Python?

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
It is used for many things, such as:

* **Web development** (server-side applications)
* **Software development** and automation workflows
* **Mathematics and data analysis**
* **System scripting and cybersecurity tasks**
* **Handling big data** and performing complex operations
* **Rapid prototyping** as well as **production-ready applications**

---

### Why Python?

* Works on different platforms (**Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.**)
* Has a **simple syntax similar to English**
* Lets developers write programs with **fewer lines of code** compared to other languages
* Runs on an interpreter system, meaning code executes **immediately after writing**
* Supports multiple programming approaches: **procedural, object-oriented, and functional**

üí° The most recent major version is **Python 3**, which I‚Äôll be using throughout these notes.

---

### Python Syntax vs Other Languages

* Python was designed for **readability**, inspired by English and mathematics.
* **New lines** are used to complete a command (unlike other languages that use semicolons).
* Python uses **indentation (whitespace)** to define scope, such as loops, functions, and classes (instead of curly braces `{}`).

Example:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

---

### Writing Our First Program

Now let‚Äôs write our very first Python program together.

1. Create a file named **`demo.py`**
2. Add the following code:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
python demo.py
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
Hello World
```

üëâ The `print()` function is used to **display messages on the screen**.

---

### Why `.py` Extension?

When we save our file as `demo.py`, the **`.py` extension** tells the system that it‚Äôs a Python script.
Examples of other extensions you might know:

* `.txt` ‚Üí Text file
* `.jpg` ‚Üí Image file
* `.html` ‚Üí Webpage file

So, `.py` is just the standard extension that lets the interpreter recognize your code as Python.


---

## Chapter 2 ‚Äì Variables and Data Types 

### What are Comments?

When I started learning Python, one of the first things I discovered was **comments**.
Comments are special notes in code that **Python ignores** during execution.

They are super useful for:

* Explaining what the code does
* Making the code more readable for you (and others)
* Temporarily disabling lines of code while testing

### Single-Line Comments

In Python, comments start with `#`.

Example:

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

You can also place a comment at the end of a line:

```python
print("Hello, World!")  # This is a comment
```

---

### Using Comments to Disable Code

Comments can also be used to **stop Python from running a line**.

Example:

```python
# print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
Cheers, Mate!
```

---

### Multiline Comments

Python doesn‚Äôt have a dedicated multiline comment syntax like some other languages.
But there are **two common ways** to write multiline comments:

#### Method 1: Using `#` on each line

```python
# This is a comment
# written in
# multiple lines
print("Hello, World!")
```

#### Method 2: Using Triple Quotes (`'''` or `"""`)

Since Python ignores string literals that aren‚Äôt assigned to variables, you can use triple quotes as multiline comments.

Example:

```python
print("Test")

'''
There is a CVE that must be patched immediately.
An attacker could exploit it to gain access.
Port 80 is exposed and serves a login page with default WordPress credentials.
'''

print("Hii")
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
Test
Hii
```

---

### Cybersecurity Student Tip üîê

As a cybersecurity learner, **commenting is powerful** when writing scripts:

* You can leave **notes about vulnerabilities** (e.g., ‚ÄúPort 80 is open ‚Äì check for weak login‚Äù).
* You can **disable dangerous payloads** while testing safely.
* Your teammates can **understand exploits and patches** quickly if your comments are clear.

---

## Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values. In Python, you don‚Äôt need to declare a variable explicitly. A variable is created the moment you assign a value to it.

```python
x = 5
y = "Tom"
print(x)
print(y)
```

**Output:**

```
5
Tom
```

---

### Variables Are Dynamic

Python variables can change type after assignment:

```python
x = 10      # x is an integer
x = "Tom"   # now x is a string
print(x)
```

**Output:**

```
Tom
```

---

### Casting

You can explicitly define a variable's data type using **casting**:

```python
x = str(3)    # '3' as string
y = int(3)    # 3 as integer
z = float(3)  # 3.0 as float

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```

**Output:**

```
<class 'str'>
<class 'int'>
<class 'float'>
```

---

### Variable Names

* Must start with a letter or underscore (`_`)
* Cannot start with a number
* Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
* Are **case-sensitive** (`age`, `Age`, `AGE` are different)
* Cannot be Python keywords (`for`, `if`, `while`, etc.)
**Legal Examples:**

```python
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"
```

**Illegal Examples:**

```python
2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"
```

---

### Multi-word Variable Names

* **Camel Case:** `myVariableName`
* **Pascal Case:** `MyVariableName`
* **Snake Case:** `my_variable_name`

---

### 1. **Camel Case**

* First word lowercase, each subsequent word starts with a capital letter.

```python
networkScannerTool = "Nmap"
print(networkScannerTool)
```

**Output:**

```
Nmap
```

---

### 2. **Pascal Case**

* Each word starts with a capital letter.

```python
NetworkScannerTool = "Nmap"
print(NetworkScannerTool)
```

**Output:**

```
Nmap
```

---

### 3. **Snake Case**

* Words are separated by underscores, all lowercase (most common in Python).

```python
network_scanner_tool = "Nmap"
print(network_scanner_tool)
```

**Output:**

```
Nmap
```
---


### Assigning Multiple Values

**Many Values to Multiple Variables:**

```python
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x, y, z)
```

**Cybersecurity Example:**

```python
tool, protocol, alert_level = "Wireshark", "HTTPS", "High"
print(tool, protocol, alert_level)
```

**One Value to Multiple Variables:**

```python
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x, y, z)
```

**Unpacking a Collection:**

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits
print(x, y, z)
```

**Question Example:**
Correct syntax to assign `'Hello World'` to 3 variables in one statement:

```python
x = y = z = 'Hello World'
```

---

### Outputting Variables

* Use `print()` with commas to output multiple variables:

```python
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)   # Python is awesome
```

* Use `+` for string concatenation (careful with spaces):

```python
print(x + " " + y + " " + z)  # Python is awesome
```

* Numbers can be added with `+`:

```python
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)  # 15
```

* Mixing string + number with `+` gives an error:

```python
x = 5
y = "John"
# print(x + y)  # Error
print(x, y)     # Works: 5 John
```

---

### Global and Local Variables

* **Global variable:** Created outside a function, accessible inside and outside functions:

```python
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
    print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()  # Python is awesome
```

* **Local variable:** Created inside a function, only accessible within the function:

```python
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
    x = "fantastic"
    print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()           # Python is fantastic
print("Python is " + x)  # Python is awesome
```

* **Global keyword:** Declare a variable inside a function to make it global:

```python
def myfunc():
    global x
    x = "fantastic"

myfunc()
print("Python is " + x)  # Python is fantastic
```

* Change a global variable inside a function:

```py
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
    global x
    x = "fantastic"

myfunc()
print("Python is " + x)  # Python is fantastic
```

---

# Data Types

When I started learning Python, one of the most important things I discovered was **data types**.
A **data type** defines the kind of value a variable can hold and what operations can be performed on it.

---

## Built-in Data Types in Python

Python has several built-in data types, grouped into categories:

* **Text Type** ‚Üí `str`
* **Numeric Types** ‚Üí `int`, `float`, `complex`
* **Sequence Types** ‚Üí `list`, `tuple`, `range`
* **Mapping Type** ‚Üí `dict`
* **Set Types** ‚Üí `set`, `frozenset`
* **Boolean Type** ‚Üí `bool`
* **Binary Types** ‚Üí `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`
* **None Type** ‚Üí `NoneType`

---

## Checking a Data Type

You can check the data type of any variable with the built-in `type()` function.

```python
x = 5
print(type(x))   # Output: <class 'int'>
```

---

## Commonly Used Data Types

When learning Python for security scripting or competitive programming, I often use these main types:

* **Integer (`int`)** ‚Äì whole numbers
* **Floating-point (`float`)** ‚Äì decimal numbers
* **String (`str`)** ‚Äì text
* **Boolean (`bool`)** ‚Äì `True` or `False`
* **None (`NoneType`)** ‚Äì represents no value

Example:

```python
a = 1        # int
b = 1.01     # float
c = "hii"    # string
d = True     # boolean
e = None     # none type
```

---

## Real-Life Example (Movie Data Table)

Think of storing movie details:

| Title        | Rating | Time Viewed | Favorite | Seen By        |
| ------------ | ------ | ----------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Star Wars    | 9.8    | 13          | True     | Tom, Jack      |
| Harry Potter | 8.6    | 30          | True     | Oggy, Nobita   |
| Matrix       | 6.1    | 5           | False    | Charlie        |
| Men in Black | 7.8    | 25          | False    | Phoenix, Gekko |

---

## Examples of Different Data Types

```python
x = "Hello World"                      # str
x = 20                                 # int
x = 20.5                               # float
x = 1j                                 # complex
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]      # list
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")      # tuple
x = range(6)                           # range
x = {"name": "John", "age": 36}        # dict
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}      # set
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana"})     # frozenset
x = True                               # bool
x = b"Hello"                           # bytes
x = bytearray(5)                       # bytearray
x = memoryview(bytes(5))               # memoryview
x = None                               # NoneType
```

---

## Setting Specific Data Types

Python automatically detects types, but I can also explicitly define them with constructor functions:

```python
x = str("Hello World")   # str
x = int(20)              # int
x = float(20.5)          # float
x = complex(1j)          # complex
x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))  # list
x = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # tuple
x = range(6)             # range
x = dict(name="John", age=36)  # dict
x = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))   # set
x = frozenset(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))  # frozenset
x = bool(5)              # bool
x = bytes(5)             # bytes
x = bytearray(5)         # bytearray
x = memoryview(bytes(5)) # memoryview
```

---

## Numbers in Python

Python has **three numeric types**:

* **int** ‚Üí Whole numbers (positive/negative, unlimited length)
* **float** ‚Üí Numbers with decimals
* **complex** ‚Üí Numbers with a real and imaginary part (e.g., `1j`)

Example:

```python
x = 1        # int
y = 2.8      # float
z = 1j       # complex

print(type(x))   # <class 'int'>
print(type(y))   # <class 'float'>
print(type(z))   # <class 'complex'>
```

---

# Numbers

When I started learning Python, I realized numbers are used everywhere ‚Äî from simple calculations to **network scripting, log analysis, and cybersecurity tools**.

Python supports **three main numeric types**:

* **int** ‚Üí integers (whole numbers)
* **float** ‚Üí floating-point numbers (decimals)
* **complex** ‚Üí numbers with real and imaginary parts

---

## Creating Numbers in Python

Variables of numeric types are created automatically when you assign values.

```python
x = 1     # int
y = 2.8   # float
z = 1j    # complex
```

You can check their type using `type()`:

```python
print(type(x))   # <class 'int'>
print(type(y))   # <class 'float'>
print(type(z))   # <class 'complex'>
```

---

## Integers (`int`)

An **integer** is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals.
Python integers can be very large (unlimited length).

Example:

```python
x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522

print(type(x))   # <class 'int'>
print(type(y))   # <class 'int'>
print(type(z))   # <class 'int'>
```

---

## Floating-Point Numbers (`float`)

A **float** is a number with a decimal point.

Example:

```python
x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59

print(type(x))   # <class 'float'>
print(type(y))   # <class 'float'>
print(type(z))   # <class 'float'>
```

Floats can also be written in **scientific notation** with `"e"` to indicate powers of 10.

```python
x = 35e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100

print(type(x))   # <class 'float'>
print(type(y))   # <class 'float'>
print(type(z))   # <class 'float'>
```

---

## Complex Numbers (`complex`)

Complex numbers are written with a `"j"` as the imaginary part.

```python
x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j

print(type(x))   # <class 'complex'>
print(type(y))   # <class 'complex'>
print(type(z))   # <class 'complex'>
```

---

## Type Conversion

Python lets you **convert between number types** using constructor functions.

```python
x = 1      # int
y = 2.8    # float
z = 1j     # complex

# Convert int ‚Üí float
a = float(x)

# Convert float ‚Üí int
b = int(y)

# Convert int ‚Üí complex
c = complex(x)

print(a)       # 1.0
print(b)       # 2
print(c)       # (1+0j)

print(type(a)) # <class 'float'>
print(type(b)) # <class 'int'>
print(type(c)) # <class 'complex'>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: You **cannot convert complex numbers** into other numeric types.

---

## Generating Random Numbers

Python does not have a built-in `random()` function, but it provides a **`random` module** for generating random numbers.

Example:

```python
import random

print(random.randrange(1, 10))  # Random number between 1 and 9
```

---
