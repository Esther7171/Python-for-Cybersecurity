## Chapter 1 â€“ Introduction to Python

Hi ðŸ‘‹, in this repo Iâ€™m sharing my **Python notes from beginner to advanced**, along with **competitive programming solutions** and **custom cybersecurity scripts**.

Letâ€™s start with the basics.

Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** in **1991**.
Over the years, it has become one of the most popular programming languages because it is:

* Easy to read and write
* Open-source and free
* Widely used in **cybersecurity, automation, AI, web development, and competitive programming**

### What is Python?

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
It is used for many things, such as:

* **Web development** (server-side applications)
* **Software development** and automation workflows
* **Mathematics and data analysis**
* **System scripting and cybersecurity tasks**
* **Handling big data** and performing complex operations
* **Rapid prototyping** as well as **production-ready applications**

---

### Why Python?

* Works on different platforms (**Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.**)
* Has a **simple syntax similar to English**
* Lets developers write programs with **fewer lines of code** compared to other languages
* Runs on an interpreter system, meaning code executes **immediately after writing**
* Supports multiple programming approaches: **procedural, object-oriented, and functional**

ðŸ’¡ The most recent major version is **Python 3**, which Iâ€™ll be using throughout these notes.

### Python Syntax vs Other Languages

* Python was designed for **readability**, inspired by English and mathematics.
* **New lines** are used to complete a command (unlike other languages that use semicolons).
* Python uses **indentation (whitespace)** to define scope, such as loops, functions, and classes (instead of curly braces `{}`).

Example:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### Writing Our First Program

Now letâ€™s write our very first Python program together.

1. Create a file named **`demo.py`**
2. Add the following code:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
python demo.py
```

âœ… Output:

```
Hello World
```

ðŸ‘‰ The `print()` function is used to **display messages on the screen**.

### Why `.py` Extension?

When we save our file as `demo.py`, the **`.py` extension** tells the system that itâ€™s a Python script.
Examples of other extensions you might know:

* `.txt` â†’ Text file
* `.jpg` â†’ Image file
* `.html` â†’ Webpage file

So, `.py` is just the standard extension that lets the interpreter recognize your code as Python.

âœ¨ Thatâ€™s your first step into Python programming!
