## Chapter 1 ‚Äì Introduction to Python

Hi üëã, in this repo I‚Äôm sharing my **Python notes from beginner to advanced**, along with **competitive programming solutions** and **custom cybersecurity scripts**.

Let‚Äôs start with the basics.

Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** in **1991**.
Over the years, it has become one of the most popular programming languages because it is:

* Easy to read and write
* Open-source and free
* Widely used in **cybersecurity, automation, AI, web development, and competitive programming**

---

### What is Python?

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
It is used for many things, such as:

* **Web development** (server-side applications)
* **Software development** and automation workflows
* **Mathematics and data analysis**
* **System scripting and cybersecurity tasks**
* **Handling big data** and performing complex operations
* **Rapid prototyping** as well as **production-ready applications**

---

### Why Python?

* Works on different platforms (**Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.**)
* Has a **simple syntax similar to English**
* Lets developers write programs with **fewer lines of code** compared to other languages
* Runs on an interpreter system, meaning code executes **immediately after writing**
* Supports multiple programming approaches: **procedural, object-oriented, and functional**

üí° The most recent major version is **Python 3**, which I‚Äôll be using throughout these notes.

---

### Python Syntax vs Other Languages

* Python was designed for **readability**, inspired by English and mathematics.
* **New lines** are used to complete a command (unlike other languages that use semicolons).
* Python uses **indentation (whitespace)** to define scope, such as loops, functions, and classes (instead of curly braces `{}`).

Example:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

---

### Writing Our First Program

Now let‚Äôs write our very first Python program together.

1. Create a file named **`demo.py`**
2. Add the following code:

```python
print("Hello World")
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
python demo.py
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
Hello World
```

üëâ The `print()` function is used to **display messages on the screen**.

---

### Why `.py` Extension?

When we save our file as `demo.py`, the **`.py` extension** tells the system that it‚Äôs a Python script.
Examples of other extensions you might know:

* `.txt` ‚Üí Text file
* `.jpg` ‚Üí Image file
* `.html` ‚Üí Webpage file

So, `.py` is just the standard extension that lets the interpreter recognize your code as Python.

## Chapter 2 ‚Äì Variables and Data Types 

### What are Comments?

When I started learning Python, one of the first things I discovered was **comments**.
Comments are special notes in code that **Python ignores** during execution.

They are super useful for:

* Explaining what the code does
* Making the code more readable for you (and others)
* Temporarily disabling lines of code while testing

### Single-Line Comments

In Python, comments start with `#`.

Example:

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
Hello, World!
```

You can also place a comment at the end of a line:

```python
print("Hello, World!")  # This is a comment
```

---

### Using Comments to Disable Code

Comments can also be used to **stop Python from running a line**.

Example:

```python
# print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
Cheers, Mate!
```

---

### Multiline Comments

Python doesn‚Äôt have a dedicated multiline comment syntax like some other languages.
But there are **two common ways** to write multiline comments:

#### Method 1: Using `#` on each line

```python
# This is a comment
# written in
# multiple lines
print("Hello, World!")
```

#### Method 2: Using Triple Quotes (`'''` or `"""`)

Since Python ignores string literals that aren‚Äôt assigned to variables, you can use triple quotes as multiline comments.

Example:

```python
print("Test")

'''
There is a CVE that must be patched immediately.
An attacker could exploit it to gain access.
Port 80 is exposed and serves a login page with default WordPress credentials.
'''

print("Hii")
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
Test
Hii
```

---

### Cybersecurity Student Tip üîê

As a cybersecurity learner, **commenting is powerful** when writing scripts:

* You can leave **notes about vulnerabilities** (e.g., ‚ÄúPort 80 is open ‚Äì check for weak login‚Äù).
* You can **disable dangerous payloads** while testing safely.
* Your teammates can **understand exploits and patches** quickly if your comments are clear.


## Variable
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Example
```
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```
output
5 john

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.


x = 10
x = "tom"
print(x)

## Casting
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

Example
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

Get the Type
You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

Example
x = 10
y = "Tom"
z = 9.9
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(x))

output:
<class 'int'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'float'>


Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for Python variables:

A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
ExampleGet your own Python Server
Legal variable names:

myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"
Example
Illegal variable names:

2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"
Remember that variable names are case-sensitive

Multi Words Variable Names
Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

Camel Case
Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

myVariableName = "John"
Pascal Case
Each word starts with a capital letter:

MyVariableName = "John"
Snake Case
Each word is separated by an underscore character:

my_variable_name = "John"



Question: Create a variable named test and assign the value car to it.
test = "car"
