# Variable 
# Assign a variable is easy gave a name = value
# x = 5 # if i print this the value of x will be printed as number 5.
# print("value of x",x)
# y = "Tom"
# print("value of y",y)
# print(x)
# print(y)


# To check the type of varible hold value we use type function
# # x = 10
# y = "Tom"
# z = 9.9
# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# print(type(z))


# Now we have some rules to assign to a 
# A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# A variable name cannot start with a number
# A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
# A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

# Assign Multiple Values
# x , y , z = "car" , "bike" , "truck"
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)

# one more example
# Assign multiple cybersecurity-related values to variables in one line
# tool, protocol, alert_level = "Wireshark", "HTTPS", "High"

# print("Tool:", tool)
# print("Protocol:", protocol)
# print("Alert Level:", alert_level)
