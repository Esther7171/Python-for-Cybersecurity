// Area & Perimeter of Rectangle

// Write a program for the following problem:

// Letâ€™s consider a rectangle of sides a = 11 and b = 13.

// Find and output area of the rectangle having sides as 

// Find and output perimeter of the rectangle having side as a & b.

// For any rectangle, the formula for area is length * breadth.

// The formula for perimeter is 2 * (length + breadth).
